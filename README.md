# Predicting Customer Churn with a Machine Learning Scaffolding

![](images/Framework.png)

This project demonstrates applying a 3-step framework to solve problems with machine learning. The purpose of this framework
is to provide a scaffolding for rapidly developing machine learning solutions.

# Framework



Machine learning has traditionally been an
ad-hoc process with a custom solution created for each problem, however, this has made it difficult for many companies to harness
the benefits of machine learning. A standardized process will make it easier to solve meaningful problems by being readily
adaptible to new use cases.
