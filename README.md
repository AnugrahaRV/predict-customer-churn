# Predicting Customer Churn with Spark

In this project, we use automated feature engineering with Featuretools to predict customer churn. We also
distribute the computation to a cluster of machines using Apache Spark. This project shows both how
to set up and solve a prediction problem, and how to scale to large datasets with distributed computing.
